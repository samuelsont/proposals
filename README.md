### 1. FusedSLAM Summary

The domain of consensus planning for distributed connected autonomous agents with different sensing modalities within a complex dynamic environment has been severely limited by high latency in communication and lack of a framework to fuse heteroscedastic sensor data streams with the intent to colocalize such distributed agents within a global coordinate system. 5G mmWave technology which enables even faster connectivity with near-zero latency has brought about a new range of possibilities for massive ubiquitous computing and machine-to-machine communication. However, the exploration of the potential for applying the technology to connected autonomous agents is still nascent. Thus, the need arises to investigate sensor fusion modalities for obtaining real-time pose estimates of the agents in a global coordinate system using 5G-powered fog computing and set out a technique for consensus planning within the global coordinate system.
